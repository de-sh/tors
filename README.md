# tors - a rust cli program to download torrent files from the internet

This is a project done to better understand how rust can be used for distributed computing. I understand that there are various implementations of the bittorrent protocol that have been already made in various other language, tors is simplistic, without all the bells and whistles, for now.

I found inspiration to create tors from reading [Jesse Li's blog post about building the same in Golang](https://blog.jse.li/posts/torrent/).
